I'm a software engineer (surprise!). I'm most experienced on the backend side of things (APIs, services micro and otherwise, etc), but I'm capable throughout the web stack.

I'm into automating all I can so that more time can be spent on the interesting work. I'm happy to do data integration/munging, migration and infrastructure work.

Available for collaboration, pro-bono work and for hire. More details and contact info at my personal website: https://anaulin.org
